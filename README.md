# Rumer

Rumer is an AirBnB-inspired project where users can create listings of their properties (with titles, descriptions, and photos) and browse and reserve other users' listings.  

Reservations are made with specific start and end dates and listings can be filtered and browsed by their availbile dates.

The project was built with a Node/Express backend, a React frontend, and MongoDB for the database.

## Roadmap

Regarding features, I'd like to implement geographic searching and filtering, similar to how AirBnB functions.

Regarding technologies, I'm considering refactoring the project, at least starting with the backend, to use TypeScript.  I'm also considering switching from MongoDB database to use PostgreSQL.
